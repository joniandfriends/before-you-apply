      <p>
        The first application should be for the primary attendee/<strong>Head of Household</strong>/the Parent or Legal Guardian or Primary Caregiver of the family, who is 18 years or older.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additional attendees’ applications should be shorter. It is intended that the <strong>Head of Household</strong> will be the person completing all applications.
      </p>

      <p>
        Payment is not required to apply. Once you are approved to attend the event, you will be given the cost information. You will then be able to make payments and/or start fundraising.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Head of Household can apply for a Personal Care Attendant at the time that they apply for the whole family. Or, if the Head of Household wishes for the Personal Care Attendant to apply on their own later, the Head of Household will need to provide the Personal Care Attendant with their family name as stated on the application.
